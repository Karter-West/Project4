This is my Final project for my CS121 class using a Bank Project that I had made for our previous Project 3. I changed it from using ArrayLists into HashMaps and used my account class to create a savings and checking subclass in order to meet the requirments of the coding side of the project. This code as a whole is a bank application that allows users to create accounts with the bank and then add and take away money as well as create new accounts.
